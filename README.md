## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

In this project I learn a lot, I learn about more on working animation effects and  I use simple but good looking css animation effects

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<p class="lorem0">Here are a few pictures. Sheâ€™s a happy girl!</p>
```
```css
.lorem0{
  background: var(--white);
  width: 70%;
  border-radius: 10px;
  animation messageEffect var(--anime);
}
@keyframes messageEffect {
  from {
    transform: translate(300px);
  }
  to{
    transform: translate(0px);
  }
}
```
```
//No js is used in this project
```

### Continued development

proper responsive site and mobile first priority is the goal of my web development journey. I strongly believe that in future I have better understanding in [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and I hope, I will not  doing coding from sratch. I will also focus on developing tools / frameworks like [angular](https://angular.io), [Django](https://djangoproject.com), [react.js](https://react.dev) and more
